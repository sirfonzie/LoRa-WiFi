## Introduction

Singapore, a frontrunner in sustainable urban development, grapples with a crucial data gap: the lack of a dedicated Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to monitor harmful gas (CO2) emissions and their intricate link to temperature fluctuations across diverse urban environments. This absence of comprehensive data impedes our ability to accurately track progress towards ambitious environmental targets and formulate informed policies for critical issues like CO2 reduction and urban heat island mitigation.

## Problem Statement

The lack of comprehensive environmental monitoring poses a significant challenge within Singapore. Currently, there is a dearth of real-time data on CO2 levels and temperature, hindering informed decision-making and sustainable practices in the country. This data gap inhibits the establishment of correlations between environmental factors and their impact on campus well-being and sustainability. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop and deploy a scalable and energy-efficient mesh network utilizing efficient communication protocols to address this challenge.

## Objectives

By providing real-time environmental data, this project aims to enable:

- Identification of correlations between CO2 levels, temperature, and campus environmental conditions.
- Evaluation of the performance and suitability of LoRa and ESP-Now protocols in comparison to traditional mesh algorithms, addressing concerns regarding data latency, reliability, network scalability, and reach.
- Provision of actionable insights to policymakers and stakeholders, facilitating evidence-based strategies for enhancing environmental sustainability within NYP Campus and contributing to broader sustainability initiatives in Singapore.

Through the resolution of this pressing problem, the project endeavors to pave the way for data-driven decision-making and sustainable management practices within NYP Campus, aligning with Singaporeâ€™s commitment to environmental stewardship.

## Architectural Overview
![Architecture](./img/architecture.png)

The system architecture is designed for efficient data collection and analysis within a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) mesh. 

It consists of two main components: the WSN mesh and the Data Collection Sink.  The WSN mesh includes sensor nodes with Liligo T3S3 LoRa 2.4Ghz modules, enabling communication via ESP-Now and LoRa protocols for optimal data transmission.  

The Data Collection Sink is the core of the architecture, with the Root Node acting as the master node within the WSN mesh. It connects to the MQTT broker using a Raspberry Pi 4b, facilitating data transmission from the mesh to the processing stages. 

The MQTT Broker, implemented with Mosquitto software in a Docker container, ensures seamless data flow between the WSN mesh and processing units. Data processing and analysis are handled by the ELK Stack, which includes Filebeat, Logstash, and Elasticsearch, all deployed in Docker containers. Filebeat collects data from the MQTT broker, Logstash processes and transforms the data, and Elasticsearch stores the processed data for visualization and analysis through Kibana.  

The architecture leverages ESP-Now and LoRa protocols for efficient WSN mesh communication, the MQTT broker for data flow management, the ELK Stack for data processing and analysis, and Docker containers for software component isolation and management
